Collate
=======

Collate is a simple language and associated self-compiling compiler.
I'm writing it purely for fun, and it's probably of no use to anyone.
It has type inference, with a vaguely SMT-inspired type solver.

The entire project is in the public domain, although attribution would be nice if you use it.
